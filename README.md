# Receipt → Spreadsheet (Rental Property Expenses)

Upload a receipt image, extract key fields, review/edit, choose property + category, and confirm to append a row to an Excel spreadsheet. Receipt images are saved for audit reference.

**Demo Mode** uses sample receipts and cached OCR output (fast + reliable for public demos).
